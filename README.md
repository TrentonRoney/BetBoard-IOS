## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 16.0+
- CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager
- Firebase project setup

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

3. **Install Dependencies**
   The project uses Firebase SDK via Swift Package Manager. Dependencies should be automatically resolved when opening the project in Xcode.

4. **Configure Firestore Security Rules**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      match /bets/{betId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
    
    // Public game data
    match /games/{gameId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null; // Adjust based on admin requirements
    }
